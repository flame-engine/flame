The title of your PR on the line above should start with a [Conventional Commit] prefix
(`fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `build:`, `ci:`,
`style:`, `revert:`). This title will later become an entry in the [CHANGELOG], so please
make sure that it summarizes the PR adequately.

Don't remove the "exclude from commit message" comments below. They are used to prevent
the PR description template from being included in the git log.
Only change the "Replace this text" parts.
