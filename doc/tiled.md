# Tiled

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is an awesome tool to design level and maps. Flame bundles a [dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/tiled) that parses tmx files and implements a very simple component for the map renderization.

Right now Tiled support on Flame is quite simple and it only renders the map on the screen, other advanced features are not yet supported.

You can check a working example [here](doc/examples/tiled).
