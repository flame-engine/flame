# Tiled

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is an great tool to design levels and maps.

Flame provides a package ([flame_tiled](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame_tiled)) which bundles
a [dart package](https://pub.dev/packages/tiled) that allows you to parse tmx (xml) files and access
the tiles, objects and everything in there.

Flame also provides a simple `Tiled` class and its component wrapper `TiledComponent`, for the map
rendering, which renders the tiles on the screen and supports rotations and flips.

Other advanced features are not yet supported, but you can easily read the objects and other
features of the tmx and add custom behaviour (eg regions for triggers and walking areas, custom
animated objects).

You can check a working example
[here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame_tiled/tree/main/example).
