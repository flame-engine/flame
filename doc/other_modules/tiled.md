# Tiled

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) is a great tool to design levels and maps.

Flame provides a package ([flame_tiled](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame_tiled)) that 
bundles a [dart](https://pub.dev/packages/tiled) package which
 allows you to parse TMX (XML) files and access the tiles, objects, and everything in there.

Flame also provides a simple `Tiled` class and its component wrapper `TiledComponent`, for the map
rendering, which renders the tiles on the screen and supports rotations and flips.
