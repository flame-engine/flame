# Forge2D

We (the Flame organization) maintain a ported version of the Box2D physics engine and our version
is called Forge2D.

If you want to use Forge2D specifically for Flame you should use our bridge library
[flame_forge2d](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d) and if you
just want to use it in a Dart project you can use the
[forge2d](https://github.com/flame-engine/forge2d) library directly.

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_forge2d` to your pubspec.yaml, as can be seen
in the
[Forge2D example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d/example)
and in the pub.dev [installation instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_forge2d).


## Forge2DGame

If you are going to use Forge2D in your project it can be a good idea to use the Forge2D specific
`FlameGame` class, `Forge2DGame`.

It is called `Forge2DGame` and it will control the adding and removal of Forge2D's `BodyComponents`
as well as your normal components.

In `Forge2DGame` the `Camera` has a zoom level set to 10 by default, so your components will be a
lot bigger than in a normal Flame game. This is due to the speed limitation in the `Forge2D` world,
which you would hit very quickly if you are using it with `zoom = 1.0`. You can easily change the
zoom level eiter by calling `super(zoom: yourZoom)` in your constructor, or do
`game.camera.zoom = yourZoom;` at a later stage.

If you are previously familiar with Box2D it can be good to know that the whole concept of the
Box2d world is mapped to `world` in the `Forge2DGame` component and every `Body` that you want to
use as a component should be a wrapped in a `BodyComponent`, and added to your `Forge2DGame`.

You can have for example a HUD and other non-physics-related components in your `Forge2DGame`'s
component list along with your physical entities. When the update is called, it will use the Forge2D
physics engine to properly update every `BodyComponent` and other components in the game will be
updated according to the normal `FlameGame` way.

In `Forge2DGame` the gravity is flipped compared to `Forge2D` to keep the same coordinate system as
in Flame, so a positive y-axis in the gravity like `Vector2(0, 10)` would be pulling bodies
downwards, meanwhile a negative y-axis would pull them upwards. The gravity can be set directly in
the constructor of the `Forge2DGame`.

A simple `Forge2DGame` implementation examples can be seen in the
[examples folder](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_forge2d/example).


## BodyComponent

The `BodyComponent` is a wrapped for the `Forge2D` body, which is the body that the physics engine
is interacting with. To create a `BodyComponent` you need to override `createBody()` and create and
return your created body.

The `BodyComponent` is by default having `renderBody = true`, since otherwise it wouldn't show
anything after you have created a `Body` and added the `BodyComponent` to the game. If you want to
turn it off you can just set (or override) `renderBody` to false.

Just like any other Flame component you can add children to the `BodyComponent`, which can be very
useful if you want to add for example animations or other components on top of your body.

The body that you create in `createBody` should be defined according to Flame's coordinate system,
not according to the coordinate system of Forge2D (where the Y-axis is flipped).


## Contact callbacks

`Forge2DGame` provides a simple out of the box solution to propagate contact events.

Contact events occur whenever two `Fixture`s meet each other. These events allows listening when
these `Fixture`s begin to come in contact (`beginContact`) and cease being in contact
(`endContact`).

There are multiple ways to listen to these events. One common way is to use the `ContactCallbacks`
class as a mixin in the `BodyComponent` where you are interested in these events.

```dart
class Ball extends BodyComponent with ContactCallbacks {
  ...
  void beginContact(Object other, Contact contact) {
    if (other is Wall) {
      // Do something here.
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

In order for the above to work, the `Ball`'s `body.userData` or contacting `fixture.userData` must be
set to a `ContactCallback`. And if `Wall` is a `BodyComponent` its `body.userData` or contacting 
`fixture.userData` must be set to `Wall`. 

If `userData` is `null` the contact events are ignored, it is `null` by default.

A convenient way of setting `userData` is to assign it when creating the body. For example:

```dart
class Ball extends BodyComponent with ContactCallbacks {
  ...

  @override
  Body createBody() {
    ...
    final bodyDef = BodyDef(
      userData = this,
    );
    ...
  }

}
```

Every time `Ball` and `Wall` begin to come in contact `beginContact` will be called, and once the
fixtures cease being in contact, `endContact` will be called.

An implementation example can be seen in the
[Flame Forge2D example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/packages/flame_forge2d/example/lib/balls.dart).


### Forge2DCamera.followBodyComponent

Just like with normal `PositionComponent`s you can make the `Forge2DCamera` follow `BodyComponent`s
by calling `camera.followBodyComponent(...)` which works the same as
[camera.followComponent](../flame/camera_and_viewport.md#camerafollowcomponent). When you want to
stop following a `BodyComponent` you should call `camera.unfollowBodyComponent`.
