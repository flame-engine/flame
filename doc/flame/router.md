This example app shows the use of the `RouterComponent` to move across multiple
screens within the game. In addition, the "pause" button stops time and applies
visual effects to the content of the page below it.

# RouterComponent

The **RouterComponent**'s job is to manage navigation across multiple screens within the game. It is
similar in spirit to Flutter's [Navigator][Flutter Navigator] class, except that it works with Flame
components instead of Flutter widgets.

A typical game will usually consist of multiple pages: the splash screen, the starting menu page,
the settings page, credits, the main game page, several pop-ups, etc. The router will organize
all these destinations and allow you to transition between them.

Internally, the `RouterComponent` contains a stack of routes. When you request it to show a route,
it will be placed on top of all other pages in the stack. Later you can `pop()` to remove the
topmost page from the stack. The pages of the router are addressed by their unique names.

Each page in the router can be either transparent or opaque. If a page is opaque, then the pages
below it in the stack are not rendered and do not receive pointer events (such as taps or drags).
On the contrary, if a page is transparent, then the page below it will be rendered and receive
events normally. Such transparent pages are useful for implementing modal dialogs, inventory or
dialogue UIs, etc.

Usage example:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  late final RouterComponent router;

  @override
  void onLoad() {
    add(
      router = RouterComponent(
        routes: {
          'home': Route(HomePage.new),
          'level-selector': Route(LevelSelectorPage.new),
          'settings': Route(SettingsPage.new, transparent: true),
          'pause': PauseRoute(),
          'confirm-dialog': OverlayRoute.existing(),
        },
        initialRoute: 'home',
      ),
    );
  }
}

class PauseRoute extends Route { ... }
```

```{note}
Use `hide Route` if any of your imported packages export another class called `Route`

eg: `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Route;`
```

## Route

The **Route** component holds information about the content of a particular page. `Route`s are
mounted as children to the `RouterComponent`.

The main property of a `Route` is its `builder` -- the function that creates the component with
the content of its page.

In addition, the routes can be either transparent or opaque (default). An opaque prevents the route
below it from rendering or receiving pointer events, a transparent route doesn't. As a rule of
thumb, declare the route opaque if it is full-screen, and transparent if it is supposed to cover
only a part of the screen.

By default, routes maintain the state of the page component after being popped from the stack
and the `builder` function is only called the first time a route is activated. Setting
`maintainState` to `false` drops the page component after the route is popped from the route stack
and the `builder` function is called each time the route is activated.

The current route can be replaced using `pushReplacementNamed` or `pushReplacement`.  Each method
simply executes `pop` on the current route and then `pushNamed` or `pushRoute`.


## OverlayRoute

The **OverlayRoute** is a special route that allows adding game overlays via the router. These
routes are transparent by default.

There are two constructors for the `OverlayRoute`. The first constructor requires a builder function
that describes how the overlay's widget is to be built. The second constructor can be used when the
builder function was already specified within the `GameWidget`:

```dart
final router = RouterComponent(
  routes: {
    'ok-dialog': OverlayRoute(
      (context, game) {
        return Center(
          child: DecoratedContainer(...),
        );
      },
    ),  // OverlayRoute
    'confirm-dialog': OverlayRoute.existing(),
  },
);
```

Overlays that were defined within the `GameWidget` don't even need to be declared within the routes
map beforehand: the `RouterComponent.pushOverlay()` method can do it for you. Once an overlay route
was registered, it can be activated either via the regular `.pushNamed()` method, or via the
`.pushOverlay()` -- the two methods will do exactly the same, though you can use the second one to
make it more clear in your code that an overlay is being added instead of a regular route.

The current overlay can be replaced using `pushReplacementOverlay`.  This method executes
`pushReplacementNamed` or `pushReplacement` based on the status of the overlay being pushed.


## ValueRoute

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: value_route
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 280
```

A **ValueRoute** is a route that will return a value when it is eventually popped from the stack.
Such routes can be used, for example, for dialog boxes that ask for some feedback from the user.

In order to use `ValueRoute`s, two steps are required:

1. Create a route derived from the `ValueRoute<T>` class, where `T` is the type of the value that
   your route will return. Inside that class override the `build()` method to construct the
   component that will be displayed. The component should use the `completeWith(value)` method to
   pop the route and return the specified value.

   ```dart
   class YesNoDialog extends ValueRoute<bool> {
     YesNoDialog(this.text) : super(value: false);
     final String text;

     @override
     Component build() {
       return PositionComponent(
         children: [
           RectangleComponent(),
           TextComponent(text: text),
           Button(
             text: 'Yes',
             action: () => completeWith(true),
           ),
           Button(
             text: 'No',
             action: () => completeWith(false),
           ),
         ],
       );
     }
   }
   ```

2. Display the route using `Router.pushAndWait()`, which returns a future that resolves with the
   value returned from the route.

   ```dart
   Future<void> foo() async {
     final result = await game.router.pushAndWait(YesNoDialog('Are you sure?'));
     if (result) {
       // ... the user is sure
     } else {
       // ... the user was not so sure
     }
   }
   ```
