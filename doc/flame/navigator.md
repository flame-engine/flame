:show: widget code infobox

This example app shows the use of the `Navigator` component to move across multiple screens within
the game. In addition, the "pause" button stops time and applies visual effects to the content of
the page below it.

# Navigator

The **Navigator** is a component whose job is to manage navigation across multiple screens within
the game. It is similar in spirit to Flutter's [Navigator][Flutter Navigator] class, except that it
works with Flame components instead of Flutter widgets.
