# Gesture Input

This is documentation for gesture inputs attached directly on the game class, most of the time you
want to detect input on your components instead, see for example the [TapCallbacks](tap_events.md)
and [DragCallbacks](drag_events.md) for that.

For other input documents, see also:

- [Keyboard Input](keyboard_input.md): for keystrokes
- [Other Inputs](other_inputs.md): For joysticks, game pads, etc.


## Intro

Inside `package:flame/gestures.dart` you can find a whole set of `mixin`s which can be included on
your game class instance to be able to receive touch input events. Below you can see the full list
of these `mixin`s and its methods:

  - onScaleUpdate
  - onScaleEnd

```

Mouse only events

```text

  - onMouseMove
 - ScrollDetector
  - onScroll
```


It is not possible to mix advanced detectors (`MultiTouch*`) with basic detectors of the same
kind, since the advanced detectors will *always win the gesture arena* and the basic detectors will
never be triggered. So for example, you can't use both `MultiTouchTapDetector` and `PanDetector`
together, since no events will be triggered for the latter (there is also an assertion for this).

Flame's GestureApi is provided by Flutter's Gesture Widgets, including
[GestureDetector widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/GestureDetector-class.html),
[RawGestureDetector widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RawGestureDetector-class.html)
and [MouseRegion widget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MouseRegion-class.html), you can
also read more about Flutter's gestures
[here](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/gestures-library.html).


## PanDetector and ScaleDetector

If you add a `PanDetector` together with a `ScaleDetector` you will be prompted with a quite cryptic
assertion from Flutter that says:

```{note}
Having both a pan gesture recognizer and a scale gesture recognizer is
redundant; scale is a superset of pan.

Just use the scale gesture recognizer.
```

This might seem strange, but `onScaleUpdate` is not only triggered when the scale should be changed,
but for all pan/drag events too. So if you need to use both of those detectors you'll have to handle
both of their logic inside `onScaleUpdate` (+`onScaleStart` and `onScaleEnd`).

For example you could do something like this if you want to move the camera on pan events and zoom
on scale events:

```dart
  late double startZoom;

  @override
  void onScaleStart(_) {
    startZoom = camera.zoom;
  }

  @override
  void onScaleUpdate(ScaleUpdateInfo info) {
    final currentScale = info.scale.global;
    if (!currentScale.isIdentity()) {
      camera.zoom = startZoom * currentScale.y;
    } else {
      camera.translateBy(-info.delta.global);
      camera.snap();
    }
  }
```

In the example above the pan events are handled with `info.delta` and the scale events with
`info.scale`, although they are theoretically both from underlying scale events.

This can also be seen in the
[zoom example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/camera_and_viewport/zoom_example.dart).


## Mouse cursor

It is also possible to change the current mouse cursor displayed on the `GameWidget` region. To do
so the following code can be used inside the `Game` class

```dart
mouseCursor.value = SystemMouseCursors.move;
```

To already initialize the `GameWidget` with a custom cursor, the `mouseCursor` property can be used

```dart
GameWidget(
  game: MouseCursorGame(),
  mouseCursor: SystemMouseCursors.move,
);
```


## Event coordinate system

On events that have positions, like for example `Tap*` or `Drag`, you will notice that the
`eventPosition` attribute includes 2 fields: `game` and `widget`. Below you will find a brief
explanation about each of them.


### global

The position where the event occurred considering the entire screen, same as
`globalPosition` in Flutter's native events.


### widget

The position where the event occurred relative to the `GameWidget` position and size, same as
`localPosition` in Flutter's native events.


## Example

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame with TapDetector {
  // Other methods omitted

  @override
  bool onTapDown(TapDownInfo info) {
    print("Player tap down on ${info.eventPosition.widget}");
    return true;
  }

  @override
  bool onTapUp(TapUpInfo info) {
    print("Player tap up on ${info.eventPosition.widget}");
    return true;
  }
}
```

You can also check more complete examples
[here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/examples/lib/stories/input/).


### GestureHitboxes

The `GestureHitboxes` mixin is used to more accurately recognize gestures on top of your
`Component`s. Say that you have a fairly round rock as a `SpriteComponent` for example, then you
don't want to register input that is in the corner of the image where the rock is not displayed,
since a `PositionComponent` is rectangular by default. Then you can use the `GestureHitboxes` mixin
to define a more accurate circle or polygon (or another shape) for which the input should be within
for the event to be registered on your component.

You can add new hitboxes to the component that has the `GestureHitboxes` mixin just like they are
added in the below `Collidable` example.

More information about how to define hitboxes can be found in the hitbox section of the
[collision detection](../collision_detection.md#shapehitbox) docs.

An example of how to use it can be seen
[here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/blob/main/examples/lib/stories/input/gesture_hitboxes_example.dart).
