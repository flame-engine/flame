# Gameplay

In this chapter we will be implementing the core of the Klondike's gameplay: how the cards move
between the stock and the waste, the piles and the foundations.

Before we begin though, let's clean up all those cards that we left scattered across the table in
the previous chapter. Open the `KlondikeGame` class and erase the loop at the bottom of `onLoad()`
that was adding 28 cards onto the table.
