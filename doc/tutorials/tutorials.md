# Tutorials

This chapter contains only one tutorial for now, but we'll be adding more soon!

- [](bare_flame_game.md) -- this tutorial focuses on setting up your environment
  for making a new Flame game. This "initial state" is assumed as a starting
  point for all other tutorials.

- [](klondike/klondike.md) -- in this tutorial we will build the Klondike
  solitaire card game.
