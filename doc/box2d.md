# Box2d

Although Flame does not implements Box2d itself, it bundles a forked port of the Java Box2d to Dart by Google.

The source of the bundled box2d on Flame can be found [here](https://github.com/feroult/box2d.dart).

There is also a simple example game that can be used as reference of how to use box2d on Flame [here](https://github.com/feroult/haunt).
