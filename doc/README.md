# Getting Started!

## About Flame

Flame is a minimalist Flutter game engine built on top of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provided a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for the common problems every game developed in Flutter will share.
Currently it provides you with: a few utilities, images/sprites/sprite sheets, audio, a game loop and a component/object system.

You can use whatever ones you want, as they are all somewhat independent.
