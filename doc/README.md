# Getting Started!

## About Flame

Flame is a modular Flutter game engine that provides a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for
games. It takes advantage of the powerful infrastructure provided by Flutter but simplifies the code
you need to build your projects.

It provides you with a simple yet effective game loop implementation, and all the surrounding
utilities that you might need to use in a game: input, images, sprites, sprite sheets, animations,
audio, components/object systems, collision detection, physics and so on.

You can pick and choose whichever parts you want, as they are all somewhat independent and modular.

We also support easy-to-use integrations with famous third party libraries and tools, like Riveapp,
tiled, Google Play Games, Forge2D (Box2D for Dart), physical gamepads and more.

The engine and its ecosystem is constantly being improved by the community, so please feel free to
reach out, open issues, PRs and make suggestions.
Give us a star if you want to help give the engine exposure and grow the community :)
