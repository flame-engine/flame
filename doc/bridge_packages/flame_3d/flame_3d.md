# flame_3d

```{note}
`flame_3d` is an extremely **experimental** package that is subject to many
breaking changes at any time and without any warning. We do not consider it to
be ready for production; but if you want to trail-blaze in a fresh, new cool
space, feel free to give it a try and help us improve it!
