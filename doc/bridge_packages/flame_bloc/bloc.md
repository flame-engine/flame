# flame_bloc

`flame_bloc` is a bridge library for using [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/) in your Flame
game. `flame_bloc` offers a simple and natural (as in similar to flutter_bloc) way to use blocs and
cubits inside a FlameGame. Bloc offers way to make game state changes predictable by regulating when
a game state change can occur and offers a single way to change game state throughout an entire
Game.

To use it in your game you just need to add `flame_bloc` to your pubspec.yaml, as can be seen in the
[Flame Bloc example](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_bloc/example)
and in the pub.dev [installation instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/flame_bloc).


## How to use

Lets assume we have a bloc that handles player inventory, first we need to make it available to our
components.

We can do that by using `FlameBlocProvider` component:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      FlameBlocProvider<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState>(
        create: () => PlayerInventoryBloc(),
        children: [
          Player(),
          // ...
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

With the above changes, the `Player` component will now have access to our bloc.

If more than one bloc needs to be provided, `FlameMultiBlocProvider` can be used in a similar
fashion:

```dart
class MyGame extends FlameGame {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      FlameMultiBlocProvider(
        providers: [
          FlameBlocProvider<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState>(
            create: () => PlayerInventoryBloc(),
          ),
          FlameBlocProvider<PlayerStatsBloc, PlayerStatsState>(
            create: () => PlayerStatsBloc(),
          ),
        ],
        children: [
          Player(),
          // ...
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Listening to states changes at the component level can be done with two approaches:

By using `FlameBlocListener` component:

```dart
class Player extends PositionComponent {
  @override
  Future<void> onLoad() async {
    await add(
      FlameBlocListener<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState>(
        listener: (state) {
          updateGear(state);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Or by using `FlameBlocListenable` mixin:

```dart

class Player extends PositionComponent
    with FlameBlocListenable<PlayerInventoryBloc, PlayerInventoryState> {

  @override
  void onNewState(state) {
    updateGear(state);
  }
}

```

If all your component need is to simply access a bloc, the `FlameBlocReader` mixin can be applied to
a component:

```dart
class Player extends PositionComponent
    with FlameBlocReader<PlayerStatsBloc, PlayerStatsState> {

  void takeHit() {
    bloc.add(const PlayerDamaged());
  }
}

```

Note that one limitation of the mixin is that it can access only a single bloc.
