# Joints

Joints are used to connect two different bodies together in various ways.
They help to simulate interactions between objects to create hinges, wheels, ropes, chains etc.

One `Body` in a joint may be of type `BodyType.static`. Joints between `BodyType.static` and/or
`BodyType.kinematic` are allowed, but have no effect and use some processing time.

To construct a `Joint`, you need to create a corresponding subclass of `JointDef`and initialize it
with its parameters.

To register a `Joint` use `world.createJoint`and later use `world.destroyJoint` when you want to
remove it.


## Built-in joints

Currently, Forge2D supports the following joints:

- [`ConstantVolumeJoint`](#constantvolumejoint)
- [`DistanceJoint`](#distancejoint)
- FrictionJoint
- GearJoint
- MotorJoint
- MouseJoint
- PrismaticJoint
- PulleyJoint
- RevoluteJoint
- RopeJoint
- WeldJoint
- WheelJoint


### `ConstantVolumeJoint`

This type of joint connects a group of bodies together and maintains a constant volume within them.
Essentially, it is a set of [`DistanceJoint`](#distancejoint)s, that connects all bodies one after
another.

It can for example be useful when simulating "soft-bodies".

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: constant_volume_joint
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 200
:height: 200
```

```dart
  final constantVolumeJoint = ConstantVolumeJointDef()
    ..frequencyHz = 10
    ..dampingRatio = 0.8;

  bodies.forEach((body) {
    constantVolumeJoint.addBody(body);
  });
    
  world.createJoint(ConstantVolumeJoint(world, constantVolumeJoint));
```

`ConstantVolumeJointDef` requires at least 3 bodies to be added using the `addBody` method. It also
has two optional parameters:

- `frequencyHz`: This parameter sets the frequency of oscillation of the joint. If it is not set to
0, the higher the value, the less springy each of the compound `DistantJoint`s are.

- `dampingRatio`: This parameter defines how quickly the oscillation comes to rest. It ranges from
0 to 1, where 0 means no damping and 1 indicates critical damping.


### `DistanceJoint`

A `DistanceJoint` constrains two points on two bodies to remain at a fixed distance from each other.

You can view this as a massless, rigid rod.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../../examples
:page: distance_joint
:show: widget code infobox
:width: 200
:height: 200
```

```dart
final distanceJointDef = DistanceJointDef()
  ..initialize(firstBody, secondBody, firstBody.worldCenter, secondBody.worldCenter)
  ..length = 10
  ..frequencyHz = 3
  ..dampingRatio = 0.2;

world.createJoint(DistanceJoint(distanceJointDef));
```

To create a `DistanceJointDef`, you can use the `initialize` method, which requires two bodies and a
world anchor point on each body. The definition uses local anchor points, allowing for a slight
violation of the constraint in the initial configuration. This is useful when saving and
loading a game.

The `DistanceJointDef` has three optional parameters that you can set:

- `length`: This parameter determines the distance between the two anchor points and must be greater
than 0. The default value is 1.

- `frequencyHz`: This parameter sets the frequency of oscillation of the joint. If it is not set
to 0, the higher the value, the less springy the joint becomes.

- `dampingRatio`: This parameter defines how quickly the oscillation comes to rest. It ranges from
0 to 1, where 0 means no damping and 1 indicates critical damping.

```{warning}
Do not use a zero or short length.
```
