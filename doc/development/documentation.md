# Documentation Site

Flame's documentation is written in **Markdown**. It is then rendered into HTML with the help of
the [Sphinx] engine and its [MyST] plugin. The rendered files are then manually (but with the help
of a script) published to [flame-docs-site], where the site is served via [GitHub Pages].

## Markdown

The main documentation site is written in Markdown. We assume that you're already familiar with the
basics of the Markdown syntax (if not, there are plenty of guides on the Internet). Instead, this
section will focus on the Markdown extensions that are enabled in our build system.


## Table of contents

The table of contents for the site must be created manually. This is done using special `{toctree}`
blocks, one per each subdirectory:

`````markdown
```{toctree}
:hidden:

First Topic    <relative_path/to_topic1.md>
Second Topic   <topic2.md>
```
`````

When adding new documents into the documentation site, make sure that they are mentioned in one of
the toctrees -- otherwise you will see a warning during the build that the document is orphaned.


## Admonitions

Admonitions are emphasized blocks of text with a distinct appearance. They are created using the
triple-backticks syntax:

`````markdown
```{note}
Please note this very important caveat.
```
```{warning}
Don't look down, or you will encounter an error.
```
```{error}
I told you so.
```
```{seealso}
Also check out this cool thingy.
```
`````

```{note}
Please note this very important caveat.
```

```{warning}
Don't look down, or you will encounter an error.
```

```{error}
I told you so.
```

```{seealso}
Also check out this cool thingy.
```


## Deprecations

The special `{deprecated}` block can be used to mark some part of documentation or syntax as being
deprecated. This block requires specifying the version when the deprecation has occurred

`````markdown
```{deprecated} v1.3.0

Please use this **other** thing instead.
```
`````

Which would be rendered like this:

```{deprecated} v1.3.0

Please use this **other** thing instead.
```


## Live examples

Our documentation site includes a custom-built **flutter-app** directive which allows creating
Flutter widgets and embedding them alongside the overall documentation content.

In Markdown, the code for inserting an embed looks like this:

`````markdown
```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: tap_events
:show: widget code popup
:width: 180
:height: 160
```
``````

Here's what the different options mean:

- **sources**: specifies the name of the root directory where the Flutter code that you wish to run
  is located. This directory must be a Flutter repository, and there must be a `pubspec.yaml` file
  there. The path is considered relative to the `doc/_sphinx` directory.

- **page**: a sub-path within the root directory given in `sources`. This option has two effects:
  first, it is appended to the path of the html page of the widget, like so: `main.dart.html?$page`.
  Secondly, the button to show the source code of the embed will display the code from the file or
  directory with the name given by `page`.

  The purpose of this option is to be able to bundle multiple examples into a single executable.
  When using this option, the `main.dart` file of the app should route the execution to the proper
  widget according to the `page` being passed.

- **show**: contains a subset of modes: `widget`, `code`, `infobox`, and `popup`. The `widget` mode
  creates an iframe with the embedded example, directly within the page. The `code` mode will show
  a button that allows the user to see the code that produced this example. The `popup` mode also
  shows a button, which displays the example in an overlay window. This is more suitable for
  demoing larger apps. Using both "widget" and "popup" modes at the same time is not recommended.
  Finally, the `infobox` mode will display the result in a floating window -- this mode is best
  combined with `widget` and `code`.

- **width**: an integer that defines the width of the embedded application.  If this is not defined,
  the width will be 100%.

- **height**: an integer that defines the height of the embedded application. If this is not
  defined, the height will be 350px.

```{flutter-app}
:sources: ../flame/examples
:page: tap_events
:show: widget code popup
```


## Standardization and Templates

For every section or package added to the documentation, naming conventions, directory structure,
and standardized table of contents are important.  Every section and package must have a table of
contents or an entry in the parent markdown file to allow navigation from the left sidebar menu in
logical or alphabetical order. Additionally, naming conventions should be followed for organization,
such as:

- bridge_packages/package_name/package_name.md
- documentation_section/documentation_section.md

```{note}
Avoid having spaces in the paths to the docs since that will keep you from
building the project due to
[this bug](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/13765).

## Building documentation locally

Building the documentation site on your own computer is fairly simple. All you need is the
following:

1. A working **Flutter** installation, accessible from the command line.

2. **Melos** command-line tool, as per the [contributing] guide.

3. A **Python** environment, with python version 3.8+ or higher. Having a dedicated python
   virtual environment is recommended but not required.

4. Install the remaining requirements using the command

   ```shell
   melos run doc-setup
   ```

Once these prerequisites are met, you can build the documentation by using the built-in Melos
target:

```shell
melos doc-build
```

The **melos doc-build** command here renders the documentation site into HTML. This command needs to
be re-run every time you make changes to any of the documents. Luckily, it is smart enough to only
rebuild the documents that have changed since the previous run, so usually, a rebuild takes only a
second or two.

If you want to automatically recompile the docs every time there is a change to one of the files
you can use the the built-in Melos target below, which will also serve and open your default
browser with the docs.

```shell
melos doc-serve
```

When using the **melos doc-serve** command, the **melos doc-build** is only needed when
there are changes to the sphinx theme. This is because the serve command both automatically
compiles the docs on changes and also hosts them locally. The docs are served at
`http://localhost:8000/` by default.

There are other make commands that you may find occasionally useful too:

- **melos doc-clean** removes all cached generated files (in case the system gets stuck in a bad
state).
- **melos doc-linkcheck** to check whether there are any broken links in the documentation.
- **melos doc-kill** removes any orphaned TCP threads running on port 8000.

The generated html files will be in the `doc/_build/html` directory, you can view them directly
by opening the file `doc/_build/html/index.html` in your browser. The only drawback is that the
browser won't allow any dynamic content in a file opened from a local drive. The solution to this
is to run **melos doc-serve**.

If you ever run the **melos doc-clean** command, the server will need to be restarted, because the
clean command deletes the entire `html` directory.
