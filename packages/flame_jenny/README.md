# flame_jenny

The **flame_jenny** library integrates `jenny` (a dialogue framework) into the Flame engine. It
offers a number of components for displaying conversations within a game.

The `jenny` library, inspired by [YarnSpinner], is a framework for embedding dialogues, interactive
conversations, narratives, or step-by-step tutorials.
