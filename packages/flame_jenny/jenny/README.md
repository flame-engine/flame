# Jenny

The **jenny** library supports building _dialogues_, interactive _conversations_, _narratives_,
or non-linear _story-telling_. The dialogue itself is written in a simple text-based Yarn language.
The `jenny` library allows you to load these `yarn` files into a YarnProject and then present this
dialogue to users within a game or an app.

The `jenny` library mimics the features and functionality of the [Yarn Spinner] library for Unity.
