# Jenny

The **jenny** library supports building *dialogues*, interactive *conversations*, *narratives*,
or non-linear *story-telling*. The dialogue itself is written in a simple text-based Yarn language.
The `jenny` library allows you to load these `yarn` files into a YarnProject and then present this
dialogue to users within a game or an app.

The `jenny` library mimics the features and functionality of the [Yarn Spinner] library for Unity.

See Jenny's [official documentation site] for more information.
