/// [DialogueLine] is a single line of "normal" text within the dialogue.
///
/// A dialogue line may contain a [character] (the name of the entity who is
/// speaking), and [tags] -- a list of hashtag tokens that specify some meta
/// information about the line.
///
/// Example of a dialogue line in yarn script:
/// ```yarn
/// Hermione: Holy cricket! You're Harry Potter.  #surprised
/// ```
/// Here the [character] is "Hermione", the [text] of the line is "Holy
/// cricket! You're Harry Potter.", and the [tags] list will contain a single
/// entry "#surprised".
///
/// A dialogue line may also contain inline expressions, which will be
/// re-evaluated every time the line is executed by the dialogue runner:
/// ```yarn
/// Jenny: My favorite color is {$favoriteColor}, what about you?
/// ```
/// After evaluation, the resulting string may be "My favorite color is
/// vantablack, what about you?".
///
/// Lastly, a dialogue line may have markup attributes. These are similar to
/// HTML tags, only they use square brackets:
/// ```yarn
/// Jenny: My [i]favorite[/i] color is [bb color=$color]{$color}[/bb].
/// ```
/// These markup attributes will not be visible in the output (i.e. the
/// resulting text is still "My favorite color is vantablack"), but they can be
/// queried in the [attributes] list, which will specify that there is an
/// attribute `[i]` around the word "favorite", and another attribute `[bb]`
/// with parameter `color` around the word "vantablack".
///
/// Inline expressions cannot contain markup attributes.
