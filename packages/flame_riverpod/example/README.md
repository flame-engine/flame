# flame_riverpod_example

The example consists of a very simple FlameGame with a custom
Component, updated alongside a comparable Flutter widget.

Both the Component and the Widget depend on a `StreamProvider`
that counts upwards indefinitely.

Both a Flame Component and a Flutter Text Widget update in real-time from
the same data source.
