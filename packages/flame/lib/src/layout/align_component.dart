/// **AlignComponent** is a layout component that positions its child within
/// itself using relative placement. It is similar to Flutter's [Align] widget.
///
/// The component requires a single [child], which will be the target of this
/// component's alignment. Of course, other children can be added to this
/// component too, but only the initial [child] will be aligned.
///
/// The [alignment] parameter describes where the child should be placed within
/// the current component. For example, if the [alignment] is `Anchor.center`,
/// then the child will be centered.
///
/// Normally, this component's size will match the size of its parent. However,
/// if you provide properties [widthFactor] or [heightFactor], then the size of
/// this component in that direction will be equal to the size of the child
/// times the corresponding factor. For example, if you set [heightFactor] to
/// 1 then the width of this component will be equal to the width of the parent,
/// but the height will match the height of the child.
///
/// ```dart
/// AlignComponent(
///   child: TextComponent('hello'),
///   alignment: Anchor.centerLeft,
/// );
/// ```
///
/// By default, the child's anchor is set equal to the [alignment] value. This
/// achieves traditional alignment behavior: for example, the center of the
/// child will be placed at the center of the current component, or bottom
/// right corner of the child can be placed in the bottom right corner of the
/// component. However, it is also possible to achieve more extravagant
/// placement by giving the child a different anchor and setting
/// [keepChildAnchor] to true. For example, if you set `alignment` to
/// `topCenter`, and child's anchor to `bottomCenter`, then the child will
/// effectively be placed above the current component:
/// ```dart
/// PlayerSprite().add(
///   AlignComponent(
///     child: HealthBar()..anchor = Anchor.bottomCenter,
///     alignment: Anchor.topCenter,
///     keepChildAnchor: true,
///   ),
/// );
/// ```

  /// [alignment] within this component's bounding box.
  ///
  /// More precisely, the child will be placed at [alignment] relative position
  /// within the current component's bounding box. The child's anchor will also
  /// be set to the [alignment], unless [keepChildAnchor] parameter is true.
