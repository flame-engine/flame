/// [Component]s are the basic building blocks for a [FlameGame].
///
/// Components are quite similar to widgets in Flutter, or to GameObjects in
/// Unity. Any entity within the game can be represented as a Component,
/// especially if that entity has some visual appearance, or if it changes over
/// time. For example, the player, the enemies, flying bullets, clouds in the
/// sky, buildings, rocks, etc -- all can be represented as components. Some
/// components may also represent more abstract entities: effects, behaviors,
/// data stores, groups.
///
/// Components are designed to be organized into a component tree, where every
/// component belongs to a single parent and owns any number of children
/// components. A [Component] must be added to the component tree in order for
/// it to become fully operational. Typically, the [FlameGame] is the root of
/// the component tree.
///
/// The components are added into the component tree using the [add] method, or
/// [addToParent]; and then later can be removed using [remove] or
/// [removeFromParent]. Note that neither adding nor removing are immediate,
/// typically these operations complete by the next game tick.
///
/// Each component goes through several lifecycle stages during its lifetime,
/// at each stage invoking certain user-defined "lifecycle methods":
///  - [onLoad] when the component is first added into the tree;
///  - [onGameResize] + [onMount] when done loading, or when the component is
///    re-added to the component tree after having been removed;
///  - [onRemove] if the component is later removed from the component tree.
///
/// The [onLoad] is only invoked once during the lifetime of the component,
/// which means you can treat it as "async constructor". When [onLoad] is
/// invoked, we guarantee that the game instance can be found via [findGame],
/// and that this game instance already has layout (i.e. knows the size of the
/// canvas).
///
/// The [onMount] is invoked when the component is done loading, and when its
/// parent is properly mounted. If a component is removed from the tree and
/// later added to another component, the [onMount] will be called again. For
/// every call to [onMount] there will be a corresponding call to [onRemove].
///
/// While the component is mounted, the following user-overridable methods are
/// invoked:
///  - [update] on every game tick;
///  - [render] after all components are done updating;
///  - [updateTree] and [renderTree] are more advanced versions of the update
///    and render callbacks, but they rarely need to be overridden by the user;
///  - [onGameResize] every time the size game's Flutter widget changes.
///
/// The [update] and [render] are two most important methods of the component's
/// lifecycle. On every game tick, first the entire component tree will be
/// [update]d, and then all the components will be [render]ed.
///
/// You may also need to override [containsLocalPoint] if the component needs to
/// respond to tap events or similar; the [componentsAtPoint] may also need to
/// be overridden if you have reimplemented [renderTree].

  //#region Lifecycle state

  /// Bitfield which keeps track of the current state of the component: which
  /// lifecycle events it has already executed, and which are currently being
  /// executed.
  ///
  /// [_initial]: the original state of the component as it was just created. In
  ///     this state no events has occurred so far.
  ///
  /// [_loading]: this flag is set while the component is running its [onLoad]
  ///     method, and can be checked via [isLoading] getter. This bit is turned
  ///     on when the component starts loading, and then off when it has
  ///     finished loading.
  ///
  /// [_loaded]: this flag is set after the component finishes running its
  ///     [onLoad] method, and can be checked via the [isLoaded] getter. Once
  ///     set, this bit is never turned off.
  ///
  /// [_mounted]: this flag is set when the component becomes properly mounted
  ///     to the component tree, and then turned off when the component is
  ///     removed from the tree.
  ///
  /// [_removing]: this bit indicates that the component is scheduled for
  ///     removal at the earliest possible opportunity, and then cleared when
  ///     the component is actually removed.
  ///
  /// The lifecycle process of a component is quite complicated. This happens
  /// for several reasons: partly because it consists of several stages, between
  /// which there are asynchronous or even physical execution gaps. In addition,
  /// the lifecycle invokes a number of user-provided callbacks, and those
  /// callbacks may attempt to modify the component.
  ///
  /// This is how a typical component's lifecycle progresses:
  ///  - First, the component is created with the [_state] variable = 0. At this
  ///    point the only operations that can be done are: to [add] it to another
  ///    component, or to add other components to it.
  ///  - When the component is [add]ed to another component (the parent), we do
  ///    the following:
  ///    - set the [_parent] variable;
  ///    - add the component to the parent's queue of pending children;
  ///    - if the component has been [_loaded] before, then do nothing else and
  ///      wait until its parent will do the mounting.
  ///    - otherwise, if the [Game] instance is accessible via [findGame], then
  ///      we start loading the component;
  ///    - otherwise we will start loading when the parent becomes mounted. This
  ///      means we're entering into an execution gap here. During this gap the
  ///      component is still in the [_initial] state, and it can be [remove]d
  ///      by the user. When the user removes the component in this state, we
  ///      simply set the [_parent] to null and remove it from the parent's
  ///      queue of pending children.
  ///  - When we [_startLoading] the component, we set the [_loading] bit,
  ///    and then [onLoad] immediately
  ///    afterwards. The onLoad will be either sync or async, in both cases we
  ///    arrange to turn on the [_loaded] bit at the end of [onLoad]'s run.
  ///  - At this point we're in an execution gap: either the async [onLoad] is
  ///    waiting to be run, or it already completed, or it was sync to begin
  ///    with -- in either case we're waiting until the component can be
  ///    mounted, and in that time the [_loading] bit is still on.
  ///    During this time the user may request to [remove] the component. If at
  ///    that moment the component is already loaded, then we remove it by
  ///    setting parent to null and deleting it from the parent's pending
  ///    children queue. If, on the other hand, the component is not loaded yet,
  ///    then we turn on the [_removing] flag only -- this is because we don't
  ///    want to set [_parent] to null while the [onLoad] may still try to
  ///    access it.
  ///  - The next step in the component's lifecycle comes when its parent
  ///    processes own pending events queue, which only happens after the parent
  ///    gets mounted. For each component in its queue of pending children, the
  ///    following checks are performed:
  ///      - if the component is already [_loaded], then it will now be
  ///        [_mount]ed;
  ///      - otherwise, if the component is not even [_loading], then it will
  ///        now [_startLoading];
  ///      - otherwise do nothing: need to wait until the component finishes
  ///        loading.
  ///  - During [_mount]ing, we perform the following sequence:
  ///      - first we run [onGameResize];
  ///      - check if the component was scheduled for removal while waiting in
  ///        the queue -- if so, remove it immediately without mounting;
  ///      - clear the [_loading] flag and start the [onMount] callback;
  ///      - set the [_mounted] bit;
  ///      - add the component to parent's list of [children];
  ///      - if the component has its own list of existing children, then mount
  ///        those;
  ///      - if the component has a list of pending children, then process the
  ///        lifecycle events queue, which would attempt to load and/or mount
  ///        these pending children.
  ///
  /// At this point the component would be at its normal, mounted state. When
  /// [remove] is invoked in this state, we (1) turn on the [_removing] bit, and
  /// (2) add the component to the "removals" lifecycle queue of its parent. The
  /// next time the parent processes its lifecycle event queue, it would take
  /// all the components from the "removals", and for each one call the
  /// [onRemove] method, clear the [_mounted] and [_removing] flags, and lastly
  /// remove the component from the official list of children.
  ///

  /// and its [_parent] will be null. Such component can be re-added into the
