/// [RouterComponent] handles transitions between multiple pages of a game.
///
/// The term **page** is used descriptively here: it is any full-screen (or
/// partial-screen) component. For example: a starting page, a settings page,
/// the main game world page, and so on. A page can also be any individual piece
/// of UI, such as a confirmation dialog box, or a user inventory pop-up.
///
/// The router doesn't handle the pages directly -- instead, it operates a stack
/// of [Route]s. Each route, in turn, manages a single page component. However,
/// routes are lazy: they will only build their pages when they become active.
///
/// Internally, the router maintains a stack of Routes. In the beginning,
/// the stack will contain the [initialRoute]. New routes can be added via the
/// [pushNamed] method, and removed with [pop]. However, the stack must be
/// kept non-empty: it is an error to attempt to remove the only remaining route
/// from the stack.
///
/// Routes that are on the stack are mounted as components. When a route is
/// popped, it is removed from the stack and unmounted. Routes can be either
/// transparent or opaque. An opaque route prevents all routes below it from
/// rendering, and also stops pointer events. In addition, routes are able to
/// stop or slow down time for the pages that they control, or to apply visual
/// effects (via decorators) to those pages.
