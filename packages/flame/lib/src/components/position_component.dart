/// A [Component] implementation that represents an object that can be

///
/// The [PositionComponent] class has no visual representation of its own
/// (except in debug mode). It is common, therefore, to derive from this
/// class, implementing a specific rendering logic. For example:
/// ```dart
/// class MyCircle extends PositionComponent {
///   MyCircle({required double radius, Paint? paint, Vector2? position})
///     : _radius = radius,
///       _paint = paint ?? Paint()..color=Color(0xFF80C080),
///       super(
///         position: position,
///         size: Vector2.all(2 * radius),
///         anchor: Anchor.center,
///       );
///
///   double _radius;
///   Paint _paint;
///
///   @override
///   void render(Canvas canvas) {
///     super.render(canvas);
///     canvas.drawCircle(Offset(_radius, _radius), _radius, _paint);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The base [PositionComponent] class can also be used as a container
/// for several other components. In this case, changing the position,
/// rotating or scaling the [PositionComponent] will affect the whole
/// group as if it was a single entity.
///
/// The main properties of this class is the [transform] (which combines
/// the [position], [angle] of rotation, and [scale]), the [size], and
/// the [anchor]. Thus, the [PositionComponent] can be imagined as an
/// abstract picture whose of a certain [size]. Within that picture
/// a point at location [anchor] is selected, and that point is designated as
/// a "logical center" of the picture. Then, a sequence of transforms is
/// applied: the picture is moved so that the anchor becomes at point
/// [position] on the screen, then the picture is rotated for [angle]
/// radians around the anchor point, and finally scaled by [scale] also
/// around the anchor point.
///
/// The [size] property of the [PositionComponent] is used primarily for
/// tap and collision detection. Thus, the [size] should be set equal to
/// the approximate bounding rectangle of the rendered picture. If you
/// do not specify the size of a PositionComponent, then it will be
/// equal to zero and the component won't be able to respond to taps.
