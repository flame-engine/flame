/// This class describes a generic 2D transform, which is a combination of
/// translations, rotations and scaling. These transforms are combined into
/// a single matrix, that can be either applied to a canvas, or used directly
/// to compute coordinate transforms.
///
/// The transform can be visualized as 2 reference frames: a "global" and
/// a "local". Originally, the two reference frames coincide. Then, the
/// following sequence of transforms are applied:
///   - translation to point [position];
///   - rotation by [angle] radians clockwise;
///   - scaling in X and Y directions by [scale] factors;
///   - final translation by [offset], in local coordinates.
///
/// The class is optimized for repeated use: the transform matrix is cached
/// and then recalculated only when the underlying properties change. Moreover,
/// recalculation of the transform is postponed until the matrix is actually
/// requested by the user. Thus, modifying multiple properties at once does
/// not incur the penalty of unnecessary recalculations.
///
/// This class implements the [ChangeNotifier] API, allowing you to subscribe
/// for notifications whenever the transform matrix changes. In addition, you
/// can subscribe to get notified when individual components of the transform
/// change: [position], [scale], and [offset] (but not [angle]).
