/// A camera translates your game coordinate system; this is useful when your
/// world is not 1:1 with your screen size.
///
/// A camera always has a current [position], however you cannot set it
/// directly. You must use some methods to ensure that the camera moves smoothly
/// as the game runs. Smoothly here means that sudden snaps should be avoided,
/// as they feel jarring to the player.
///
/// There are three major factors that determine the camera position:
///
/// * Follow
/// If you want, you can call [followComponent] at the beginning of your
/// stage/world/level, and provided a [PositionComponent].
/// The camera will follow this component making sure its position is fixed
/// on the screen.
/// You can set the relative position of the screen you want the follow
/// object to stay in (normally the center), and you can even change that
/// and get a smooth transition.
///
/// * Move
/// You can alternatively move the camera to a specific world coordinate.
/// This will set the top left of the camera and will ignore any existing follow
/// rules and move the camera smoothly until it reaches the desired destination.
///
/// * Shake
/// Regardless of the the previous rules, you can additionally add a shake
/// effect for a brief period of time on top of the current coordinate.
/// The shake adds a random immediate delta to each tick to simulate the shake
/// effect.
///
/// Note: in the context of the FlameGame, the camera effectively translates
/// the position where components are rendered with relation to the Viewport.
/// Components marked as `positionType = PositionType.viewport;` are
/// always rendered in screen coordinates, bypassing the camera altogether.
