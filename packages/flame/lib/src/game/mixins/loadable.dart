/// What it provides in practice is a cache for [onLoad], so that a
/// component/class can be certain that [onLoad] only runs once which then gives
/// the possibility to do late initializations in [onLoad].
///
/// It also provides empty implementations of [onMount] and [onRemove] which are
/// called when the implementing class/component is added or removed from a
/// parent/widget, in that respective order.

  /// to be resolved before adding it.
  /// If `null` is returned, the class is added right away.
  ///
  /// The default implementation just returns null.
  ///
  /// This can be overwritten to add custom logic to the component loading.

  /// Future<void> onLoad() async {
  ///   myImage = await gameRef.load('my_image.png');
  /// }
  /// ```

  /// [Future] to be resolved before adding it.
  /// If `null` is returned, the class is added right away.
  ///
  /// This can be overwritten to add custom logic to the component's mounting.

  ///   position = parent!.size / 2;
