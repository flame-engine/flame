/// The **GameWidget** is a Flutter widget which is used to insert a [Game]
/// instance into the Flutter widget tree.
///
/// The `GameWidget` is sufficiently feature-rich to run as the root of your
/// Flutter application. Thus, the simplest way to use `GameWidget` is like
/// this:
/// ```dart
/// void main() {
///   runApp(
///     GameWidget(game: MyGame()),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// At the same time, `GameWidget` is a regular Flutter widget, and can be
/// inserted arbitrarily deep into the widget tree, including the possibility
/// of having multiple `GameWidget`s within a single app.
///
/// The layout behavior of this widget is that it will expand to fill all
/// available space. Thus, when used as a root widget it will make the app
/// full-screen. Inside any other layout widget it will take as much space as
/// possible.
///
/// In addition to hosting a [Game] instance, the `GameWidget` also provides
/// some structural support, with the following features:
/// - [loadingBuilder] to display something while the game is loading;
/// - [errorBuilder] which will be shows if the game throws an error;
/// - [backgroundBuilder] to draw some decoration behind the game;
/// - [overlayBuilderMap] to draw one or more widgets on top of the game.
///
/// It should be noted that `GameWidget` does not clip the content of its
/// canvas, which means the game can potentially draw outside of its boundaries
/// (not always, depending on which camera is used). If this is not desired,
/// then consider wrapping the widget in Flutter's [ClipRect].
