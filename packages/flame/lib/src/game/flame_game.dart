    In the future (maybe as early as v1.10.0) this camera will be removed,

    `FlameGame.camera`.
    
    This is the simplest way of using the CameraComponent:
    1. Instead of adding the root components directly to your game with `add`,
       add them to the world.
       
       world.add(yourComponent);
    
    2. (Optional) If you want to add a HUD component, instead of using
       PositionType, add the component as a child of the viewport.
       
       camera.viewport.add(yourHudComponent);
