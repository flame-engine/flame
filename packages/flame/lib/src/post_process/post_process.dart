/// A way to apply effects to a whole component tree.
///
/// This is specially useful for applying effects based on [FragmentShader]s.
///
/// Post processes are created by sub-classing  and implementing the
/// [postProcess] method.
///
/// Within the [postProcess] method, you can use the [renderSubtree] method
/// to render the component tree. This method will take care of setting up
/// the context for the post process, so children can know if they are being
/// rendered within a post process by using
/// [PostProcessingContextFinder.findPostProcessFromContext].
///
/// The subtree of a post process is the children of the owner, if it is a
/// [PostProcessComponent], or the [World] if
/// the owner is a [CameraComponent]. When using a
/// [PostProcessSequentialGroup], the subtree also includes the preceding
/// post processes in the group.
///
/// Another useful method is [rasterizeSubtree], which will render the component
/// tree to an image. This is useful for using such image as a texture in
/// a shader.
///
/// Post process can be combined using [PostProcessGroup] or
/// [PostProcessSequentialGroup] to build a chain of post processes.
///
/// Post processes can be used via [CameraComponent.postProcess] or
/// [PostProcessComponent].
///
/// A post process may even render a subtree multiple times if it needs to.
/// In addition, if children check for
/// [PostProcessingContextFinder.findPostProcessFromContext],
/// they may even render differently in each render pass.
/// Ideal for mask textures.
///
/// See also:
/// - [PostProcessComponent] for a component that applies a post process
/// - [PostProcessGroup] for a group of post processes that will be applied
///   in parallel
/// - [PostProcessSequentialGroup] for a group of post processes that will be
///   applied in sequence
/// - [FragmentProgram] for a way to create post processes using fragment
///   shaders
/// - [PostProcessingContextFinder] for a way to access the post process
