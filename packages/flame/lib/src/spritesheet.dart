/// Utility class to help extract animations and sprites from a sprite sheet
/// image.
///
/// A sprite sheet is a single image in which several regions can be defined as
/// individual sprites.
/// For the purposes of this class, all of these regions must be identically
/// sized rectangles.
/// You can use the [Sprite] class directly if you want to have varying shapes.
///
/// Each sprite in this sheet can be identified either by it's (row, col) pair
/// or by it's "id", which is basically it's sequenced index if the image is put
/// in a single line. The sprites can be used to compose an animation easily if
/// all the frames are sequentially on the same row.
/// Sprites are lazily generated but cached.
