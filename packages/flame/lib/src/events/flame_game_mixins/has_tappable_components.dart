/// This mixin allows a [FlameGame] to respond to tap events, and also delivers
/// those events to components that have the [TapCallbacks] mixin.
///
/// The following events are supported by the mixin: [onTapDown], [onTapUp],
/// [onTapCancel] and [onLongTapDown] -- see their individual descriptions for
/// more details. There is no "onTap" event though -- use [onTapUp] instead.
///
/// Each event handler can be overridden. One scenario when this could be useful
/// is to check the `event.handled` property after the event has been sent down
/// the component tree.
///
/// === Usage notes ===
/// - If your game uses components with [TapCallbacks], then this mixin must be
///   added to the [FlameGame] in order for [TapCallbacks] to work properly.
/// - If your game also uses [Tappable] components, then add the
///   [HasTappablesBridge] mixin as well (instead of `HasTappables`).
/// - If your game has no tappable components, then do not use this mixin.
///   Instead, consider `MultiTouchTapDetector`.

  /// delivered to the topmost such component, and then propagated to the
  /// components below only if explicitly requested.
