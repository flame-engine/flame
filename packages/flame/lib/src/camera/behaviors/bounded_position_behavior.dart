/// within the bounds. If it does, then no adjustment are made. However, if this
/// component detects that the target has left the permitted region, it will
/// return it into the [bounds] by moving towards the last known good position
/// and stopping as close to the boundary as possible. The [precision] parameter
/// controls how close to the boundary we want to get before stopping.
///
/// Here [target] is typically the component to which this behavior is attached,
/// but it can also be set explicitly in the constructor. If the target is not
/// passed explicitly in the constructor, then the parent component must be a
/// [PositionProvider].
