/// {@template component_3d}
/// [Component3D]s are the basic building blocks for a 3D [FlameGame].
///
/// It is a [Component] implementation that represents a 3D object that can be
/// freely moved around in 3D space, rotated, and scaled.
///
/// The [Component3D] class has no visual representation of its own (except in
/// debug mode). It is common, therefore, to derive from this class
/// and implement a specific rendering logic.
///
/// The base [Component3D] class can also be used as a container
/// for several other components. In this case, changing the position,
/// rotating or scaling the [Component3D] will affect the whole
/// group as if it was a single entity.
///
/// The main property of this class is the [transform] (which combines
/// the [position], [rotation], and [scale]). Thus, the [Component3D] can be
/// seen as an object in 3D space where you can change its perceived
/// visualization.
///
/// See the [MeshComponent] for a [Component3D] that has a visual representation
/// by using [Mesh]es
/// {@endtemplate}
