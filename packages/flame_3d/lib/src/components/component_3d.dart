/// {@template component_3d}
/// [Component3D] is a base class for any concept that lives in 3D space.
///
/// It is a [Component] implementation that represents a 3D object that can be
/// freely moved around in 3D space, rotated, and scaled.
///
/// The main property of this class is the [transform] (which combines
/// the [position], [rotation], and [scale]). Thus, the [Component3D] can be
/// seen as an object in 3D space.
///
/// It is typically not used directly, but rather use one of the following
/// implementations:
/// - [Object3D] for a 3D object that can be bound and rendered by the GPU
/// - [LightComponent] for a light source that affects how objects are rendered
///
/// If you want to have a pure group for several components, you have two
/// options:
/// - Use an [Object3D], the group itself will have some superfluous render
/// logic but should not affect your children.
/// - Extend the abstract class [Component3D] yourself.
///
/// The base [Component3D] class can also be used as a container
/// for several other components. In this case, changing the position,
/// rotating or scaling the [Component3D] will affect the whole
/// group as if it was a single entity.
