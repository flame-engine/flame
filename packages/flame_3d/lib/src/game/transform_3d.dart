/// {@template transform_3d}
/// This class describes a generic 3D transform, which is a combination of
/// translations, rotations and scaling. These transforms are combined into a
/// single matrix, that can be either applied to a graphical device like the
/// canvas, composed with another transform, or used directly to convert
/// coordinates.
///
/// The transform can be visualized as 2 reference frames: a "global" and
/// a "local". At first, these two reference frames coincide. Then, the
/// following sequence of transforms is applied:
///   - translation to point [position];
///   - rotate using the [rotation];
///   - scaling in X, Y and Z directions by [scale] factors.
///
/// The class is optimized for repeated use: the transform matrix is cached
/// and then recalculated only when the underlying properties change. Moreover,
/// recalculation of the transform is postponed until the matrix is actually
/// requested by the user. Thus, modifying multiple properties at once does
/// not incur the penalty of unnecessary recalculations.
///
/// This class implements the [ChangeNotifier] API, allowing you to subscribe
/// for notifications whenever the transform matrix changes. In addition, you
/// can subscribe to get notified when individual components of the transform
/// change: [position], [scale], and [rotation].
