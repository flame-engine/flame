# flame_yarn

The `flame_yarn` library supports dialogue and narration within games. It will prove useful for any
game that has elements of story-telling, or conversational mechanics. See [documentation] for more
details.

This library was inspired by [Yarn Spinner](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev) for Unity.
