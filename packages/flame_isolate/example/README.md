# flutter_colonists

A tiny example where jobs and workers are paired together by running a path finding algorithm in
an isolate using flame_isolate.

You can toggle between compute types by tapping the HUD element in the top right corner.

Keyboard bindings for the game are:

- `WASD` for moving the camera.
- `Num+ Num-` for zooming in and out.
