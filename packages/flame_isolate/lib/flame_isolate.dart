/// Mixin on [Component] that holds an instance of a long running isolate using
/// the library integral_isolates.
///
/// Using the isolate is done by just running [isolateCompute] function the same
/// way you would run Flutter's compute function or [isolateComputeStream] if
/// your work returns a [Stream].
///
/// Keep in mind that every component you create and add with this mixin to the
/// game will create and hold it's own isolate. This makes it easy to
/// accidentally create a lot of isolates if attached to every instance of an
/// NPC for example. What youÂ´probably want to do is to instead create a manager
/// component that does all the calculations and controls the NPCs.
///
/// The following is an example of running a world update cycle when enough time
/// has passed.
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyGame extends FlameGame with FlameIsolate {
///   @override
///   void update(double dt) {
///     if (shouldRecalculate) {
///       compute(recalculateWorld, worldData).then(updateWorld);
///     }
///     return super.update(dt);
///   }
/// }
/// ```
