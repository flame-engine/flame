A Very Good Project created by Very Good CLI.

## Installation 💻

**❗ In order to start using Flame Lottie you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

```yaml
dependencies:
  flame_lottie:
```

```sh
flutter packages get
```

## Continuous Integration 🤖

Flame Lottie comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].

## Running Tests 🧪

For first time users, install the [very_good_cli][very_good_cli_link]:
