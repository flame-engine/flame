## Features

The goal of the Flame Engine is to provide a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for common
problems that games developed with Flutter might share.

Some of the key features provided are:

- A game loop.
- A component/object system (FCS).
- Effects and particles.
- Collision detection.
- Gesture and input handling.
- Images, animations, sprites, and sprite sheets.
- General utilities to make development easier.

On top of those features, you can augment Flame with bridge packages. Through these libraries,
you will be able to access bindings to other packages, including custom Flame components and
helpers, in order to make integrations seamless.

Flame officially provides bridge libraries to the following packages:

- [flame_audio](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame_audio) for
