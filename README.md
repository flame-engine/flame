## Help

There is a Flame community on [Blue Fire's Discord server](https://discord.gg/5unKpdQD78) where you
can ask any of your Flame related questions.

If you are more comfortable with StackOverflow, you can also create a question there. Add the
[Flame tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flame), to make sure that anyone following
the tag can help out.


## Features

The goal of the Flame Engine is to provide a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for common
problems that games developed with Flutter might share.

Some of the key features provided are:

- A game loop.
- A component/object system (FCS).
- Effects and particles.
- Collision detection.
- Gesture and input handling.
- Images, animations, sprites, and sprite sheets.
- General utilities to make development easier.

On top of those features, you can augment Flame with bridge packages. Through these libraries,
you will be able to access bindings to other packages, including custom Flame components and
helpers, in order to make integrations seamless.

Flame officially provides bridge libraries to the following packages:

- [flame_audio][flame_audio] for [AudioPlayers][audioplayers]: Play multiple audio files
simultaneously.
- [flame_bloc][flame_bloc] for [Bloc][bloc]: A predictable state management library.
- [flame_fire_atlas][flame_fire_atlas] for [FireAtlas][fireatlas]: Create texture atlases for games.
- [flame_forge2d][flame_forge2d] for [Forge2D][forge2d]: A Box2D physics engine.
- [flame_isolate][flame_isolate] - Makes it easy to use [Flutter Isolates][flutter_isolates] in
a Flame game.
- [flame_lint][flame_lint] - Our set of linting (`analysis_options.yaml`) rules.
- [flame_lottie][flame_lottie] - Support for [Lottie][lottie] animation in Flame.
- [flame_network_assets][flame_network_assets] - Helpers to load game assets from
network.
- [flame_oxygen][flame_oxygen] for [Oxygen][oxygen]: A lightweight Entity Component System (ECS)
framework.
- [flame_rive][flame_rive] for [Rive][rive]: Create interactive animations.
- [flame_svg][flame_svg] for [flutter_svg][flutter_svg]: Draw SVG files in Flutter.
- [flame_tiled][flame_tiled] for [Tiled][tiled]: 2D tile map level editor.
