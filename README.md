## About 1.0.0

This is a release candidate for version 1.0.0 of Flame. This is not ready for production use and the documentation found here is not completely updated according to the code, also everything here can be changed before the full release.

Use this version to get a preview of how the new Flame version will be and also to give the team feedback about the new structure and/or features.

Checkout the branches `develop-v0.x` and `master-v0.x` for the current last 0.x version. However no new updates will be added to v0 except for bugfixes.

The current v1 release is `1.0.0-rc6` on pub. The last stable version so far is `0.29.0`. Feel free to choose the one that better suits your need.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a complete set of out-of-the-way solutions for the common problems every game developed in Flutter will share.

Currently it provides you with:
 - a game loop
 - a component/object system
 - a physics engine (Forge2D, available through [flame_Forge2D](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame_Forge2D))
 - audio support
 - effects and particles
 - gesture and input support
 - images, sprites and sprite sheets
 - basic Rive support
 - and a few other utilities to make development easier

You can use whichever ones you want, as they are all somewhat independent.
