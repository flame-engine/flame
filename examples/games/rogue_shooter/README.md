# Flame Performance Test Game

This is a simple scrolling shooter game which we use for testing the performance of Flame,
since it uses a lot of components and hitboxes. When it reaches a certain amount of
components (counted in the lower right corner) you can expect it to drop a bit in FPS,
depending on what platform you are on.
