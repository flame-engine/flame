This example shows two games having another game as a parent.
One game contains draggable components and the other is a rotating square with
other square children.
After 5 seconds, one of the components from the game with draggable squares
changes its parent from its original game to the component that is rotating.
After another 5 seconds it changes back to its original parent, and so on.
