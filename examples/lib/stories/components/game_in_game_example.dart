    This example shows two games having another game as a parent.
    One game contains draggable components and the other is a rotating square

    After 5 seconds, one of the components from the game with draggable squares
    changes its parent from its original game to the component that is rotating.
    After another 5 seconds it changes back to its original parent, and so on.
