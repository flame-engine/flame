# Flame Examples

This is a set of small examples showcasing specific features of the Flame Engine; it's a great
source of learning how to use certain things.
[See it live here](https://examples.flame-engine.org/).

This app is composed of a main menu in which you can select one of the examples and play with it.
Each example is a standalone game and is contained within its own file, so you can easily checkout
the code and see how it works.

For a very simple, but complete game in Flame, check the
[example folder inside the Flame package](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/packages/flame/example).
