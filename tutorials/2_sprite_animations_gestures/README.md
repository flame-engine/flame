# Basic: Sprites, Animations and Gestures

This tutorial will introduce you to:

 - `Sprite`: Sprites are how we draw images, or portions of an image in Flame.
 - `SpriteAnimation`: SpriteAnimations are animations composed from sprites, where each sprite represents a frame.
 - Gesture input: Input is a crucial part of game development, on this tutorial you will learn how to use one of the most basic of them, the tap detector.

All the code of this tutorial code can be found [here](./code) and is based on the Flame `1.0.0-rc8` version.

By the end of this tutorial you will have built a simple game which renders a button which when pressed, makes a small vampire robot run, that will look like this:
